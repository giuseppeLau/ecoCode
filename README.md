A version of the ecoCode Sonarqube plugin where i added the "Prefer Comparison to Zero" Java rule.
The choice of this rule is dictated by the fact that Rocheteau, Jérôme, Virginie Gaillard, and Lamya Belhaj, "How Green Are Java
Best Coding Practices?", In SMARTGREENS, pp. 235-246. 2014. states that in Java Loops, using comparison to zero leads to a 68.66% gain
in terms of Power Saving.
